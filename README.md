## Questions-and-Answers
## 1. What is Computer Vision and How Does it Relate to Human Vision?

**Computer Vision** is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to understand and interpret visual information from images and videos. It is inspired by the way humans see and process visual information, aiming to make machines perform similar visual tasks such as recognizing objects, faces, and scenes.

While human vision relies on the brain to process visual inputs, computer vision uses algorithms and models to analyze and understand visual data. The goal is to replicate human-like visual perception in machines.
